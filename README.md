This project is in response to an assignment which the requirement is as follows;

Developing and designing a small application of any kind that incorporates the use of APIs.
It is focus to test students ability to use external APIs to fetch and display relevant data in your app.
The external APIs in developing the web application as suggested by the project prompt is: https://rapidapi.com/categories. Other prompt of the project is as follows. Or any sources you prefer (Careful to vet the public APIs you use as some might be malicious) You will focus on using external APIs (e.g. APIs for travel, entertainment, etc.) and extending the functionality of your application by making use of a public API of your choice The application you come up with should be useful and not gimmicky (i.e. focus should be on functionality, not bells and whistles like crazy and over-the-top UI. A CLI app is also acceptable) You should also display the data in an easy-to-use and understand format (e.g. statistical data, etc.) and let the user interact with the data you provided (e.g. sort, etc.) Along with this Github link to this app you make, a small demo of a 2 min video showing us how to use the app is also submitted;

The link to the rapid APIs used for this project is given as; https://rapidapi.com/worldapi/api/open-weather13

HOW TO USE
1. After launching the app, users are prompted to input their country name and city name to check the weather of that particular place inputed and click the check Weather button.
